# Spectrum Emulator

## Overview
This project is a homebrew ZX Spectrum emulator written in C with SDL2 for video, audio, and input. It focuses on accurately modelling the original hardware's Z80 CPU, display timing, and keyboard matrix while remaining small enough to hack on for learning and experimentation.

## Prerequisites
Before building, make sure the following tools and development headers are available:

- `gcc` or another C11-compatible compiler
- `make`
- SDL2 development libraries (headers and runtime)
- `pkg-config` to locate SDL2 on Unix-like systems
- Optional: `sdl2-config` for additional configuration helpers on some platforms

The provided `./configure` helper script can verify these dependencies and suggest installation commands on Linux distributions.

## Building

### Linux
1. Run `./configure` to verify that the compiler and SDL2 development files are available.
2. Build the emulator with `make`.
3. The resulting executable (`spectrum`) will be placed in the project root.

If you are working from the Codex environment used by the automation tooling in
this repository, you can bootstrap the required dependencies and export sane
defaults by running:

```bash
source scripts/codex_env.sh --install-deps --configure
```

Sourcing the script without arguments simply exports the recommended compiler
flags while allowing you to manage dependencies manually.

### Windows
1. Ensure a POSIX-compatible shell environment such as MSYS2 or Cygwin with SDL2 development packages installed.
2. Use `./configure` (optional on Windows) or confirm that `gcc`, `pkg-config`, and SDL2 are available in your environment.
3. Build with `make -f Makefile.win` to produce the Windows binary.

## Running
Launch the compiled executable from the command line with a 16 KB Spectrum ROM image:

```bash
./spectrum path/to/48k.rom
```

If no ROM is specified the bundled `48.rom` image in the project root is used automatically. The emulator will load the ROM into memory and immediately begin execution once SDL initialisation succeeds.

For audio debugging you can mirror the generated beeper samples to a WAV file with the optional dump flag:

```bash
./spectrum --audio-dump beeper.wav path/to/48k.rom
```

The WAV stream is captured directly from the audio callback, allowing offline analysis with tools such as Audacity.

If you need to troubleshoot the beeper timing internals, pass `--beeper-log` to re-enable the detailed latency logs that are now
disabled by default:

```bash
./spectrum --beeper-log path/to/48k.rom
```

### Loading and saving tapes

Real-time cassette emulation is available for standard `.tap` dumps, `.tzx` images that use standard speed data blocks, and mono PCM `.wav` captures. Supply
one of the tape options when launching the emulator and the EAR input will be driven automatically during `LOAD`/`MERGE` calls:

```bash
./spectrum --tap software.tap
./spectrum --tzx demo.tzx
./spectrum --wav digitized.wav
```

You can also skip the explicit flags and pass a tape image directly. The emulator
infers `.tap`, `.tzx`, and `.wav` formats from positional arguments, so running
`./spectrum digitized.wav` loads the bundled ROM and cues the specified tape at
startup.

Loaded tapes remain cued at the start. Press **F5** to begin playback when the Spectrum is ready to `LOAD`, use **F6** to pause/stop, and tap **F7** to rewind to the beginning at any time.

While a tape source or recording destination is configured, a status panel in the upper border shows the current deck mode and a running counter so you can monitor playback and capture progress without leaving the emulator window. The panel exposes on-screen play, stop, rewind, and record controls so you can drive the deck entirely with the mouse when preferred.

To capture the MIC output generated by `SAVE`, provide `--save-tap` for a decoded `.tap` container or `--save-wav` for a raw audio
dump. The emulator records the cassette pulses while the ROM routines execute and writes the selected format on exit:

```bash
./spectrum --save-tap recording.tap
./spectrum --save-wav recording.wav
```

When a recording destination is configured, press **F8** or click the record button to arm the virtual deck. A normal press clears any previous capture, while holding **Shift** (or Shift-clicking the on-screen control) appends the new data to the existing WAV instead. If you have mounted a WAV image without passing `--save-wav`, the record control reuses that file so you can overwrite it or extend it in place.

Loading and saving can be combined, allowing you to simultaneously play an input tape and archive new content:

```bash
./spectrum --tap loader.tap --save-tap my_dump.tap
./spectrum --tzx loader.tzx --save-wav capture.wav
./spectrum --wav digitized.wav --save-tap restore.tap
```

The WAV loader expects mono 8- or 16-bit PCM streams and derives tape transitions by tracking zero-crossings, making it suitable for replaying the emulator's own `--save-wav` output or other digitized cassette recordings.

At present the TZX reader accepts standard speed blocks (`0x10`). Future updates may broaden support for additional block types
and direct snapshot formats.

## Controls
The emulator mirrors the original ZX Spectrum's keyboard matrix. The primary host-to-Spectrum key mapping is:

| Spectrum Key Row | Host Keyboard |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Row 0            | Left Shift, Z, X, C, V |
| Row 1            | A, S, D, F, G |
| Row 2            | Q, W, E, R, T |
| Row 3            | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| Row 4            | 0, 9, 8, 7, 6 (Backspace emulates `SHIFT+0`) |
| Row 5            | P, O, I, U, Y |
| Row 6            | Enter, L, K, J, H |
| Row 7            | Space, Left/Right Ctrl, M, N, B |

Additional host shortcuts:

- Close the emulator window or use your window manager's close button to exit.
- Toggle the internal beeper through the Spectrum's standard `BEEP` command.
- F5 Play, F6 Stop, F7 Rewind, F8 Record (Shift+F8 appends to the current WAV when available).

## Roadmap
- Expand tape and snapshot format coverage beyond standard-speed `.tap`/`.tzx` images.
- Improve CPU accuracy with undocumented opcode coverage and interrupt timing.
- Add configurable key bindings and joystick emulation.
- Provide automated tests and continuous integration builds across platforms.
