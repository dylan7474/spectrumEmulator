# Agent Instructions

- Use 4 spaces for indentation in Markdown and shell scripts. Tabs are only acceptable where the syntax demands them (for example, Makefile recipe lines).
- Document any new build targets or developer workflows in the README to keep it aligned with the tooling.
- Keep shell scripts POSIX-compliant and ensure they are marked executable when committed.
